![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1b07585-3b60-400c-a10e-2daffa1f31ad)

**Vulnerable Bank** is an intentionally insecure mobile application built for security engineers, penetration testers, and mobile app security learners to practice and demonstrate real-world exploitation of insecure coding practices.

This mobile app acts as a frontend for the [Vulnerable Bank API](https://github.com/Commando-X/vuln-bank), a purposely vulnerable web API with typical banking features.

- Demonstrate OWASP Mobile Top 10 risks
- Build or demo mobile DevSecOps pipelines
- Run Capture-the-Flag (CTF) scenarios or internal red team labs

---

## 🚧 Build It Yourself (Optional)

### 🧱 Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- Android Studio (with emulator or physical device)
- Java JDK 11+
- Git

### 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Commando-X/vuln-bank-mobile

npm install
```

Start Metro server:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

In another terminal:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

> ⚠️ If testing on a real device, make sure to:
> - Update `API_BASE` in `App.tsx` with your server’s IP
> - Allow HTTP traffic by setting `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in your manifest

## 🧠 Fun Security Challenges Inside

- Can you extract the admin JWT?
- Can you discover the debug API and access hidden user data?
- Can you reverse engineer the APK and find credentials in SharedPreferences?
- Can you tamper with API requests?

---

## 🧑‍💻 Dev Notes

- Written in **React Native (TypeScript)**
- Icons from `react-native-vector-icons`
- Emulator-friendly, but can be bundled for real Android devices
- Secrets deliberately placed in:
  - Java/Kotlin source code
  - SharedPreferences
  - AndroidManifest.xml

## 🛡 Disclaimer

> This app is intended **strictly for educational purposes**.  
> Do **NOT** install this app on real production devices or use with real financial data.  
> All API endpoints are intentionally insecure and should only be used in isolated testing environments.
